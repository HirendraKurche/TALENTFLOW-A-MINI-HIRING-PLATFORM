## Common Issues & Solutions

### Port Already in Use
**Issue:** `Port 5173 is in use`  
**Solution:** Vite automatically tries the next available port. Just use the port shown in the terminal.

### Dependencies Failed to Install
**Issue:** `npm install` errors  
**Solution:** 
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### TypeScript Errors in IDE
**Issue:** Red squiggles everywhere  
**Solution:** Restart your TypeScript server (VS Code: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P ‚Üí "TypeScript: Restart TS Server")

### Data Not Persisting
**Issue:** Data disappears on refresh  
**Solution:** Check if IndexedDB is enabled in your browser (it should be by default)

---

## Browser DevTools Tips

### View IndexedDB Data
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Expand **IndexedDB** ‚Üí **TalentFlowDB**
4. Click on any table (jobs, candidates, assessments)
5. See all your data!

### View Network Requests
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Filter by **XHR** or **Fetch**
4. See simulated API calls to MirageJS

### Check Console for Logs
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. See "Synced data from IndexedDB" on app start
4. See any errors or warnings (there shouldn't be any!)

---

## Performance Tips

### For Best Experience
- Use Chrome or Edge for best DevTools
- Keep browser extensions minimal (ad blockers can slow things down)
- Close other tabs if you have 50+ open

### Testing with 10,000+ Candidates
Want to stress-test the virtualized list?

1. Open `client/src/lib/mirage.ts`
2. Change this line:
   ```typescript
   for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
   ```
   to:
   ```typescript
   for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
   ```
3. Restart the dev server
4. Visit the Candidates page
5. Scroll smoothly through 10,000 items! üöÄ
