## What Was Missing & What I Implemented

### 1. **Conditional Question UI in Assessment Builder** ✅
**Status:** Previously missing, now fully implemented

**Implementation:**
- Added UI controls in `assessment-builder.tsx` to configure conditional logic
- Users can now specify `showIfQuestionId` and `showIfEquals` for any question
- Questions conditionally appear based on responses to other questions
- Runtime evaluation works seamlessly in `assessment-run.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
